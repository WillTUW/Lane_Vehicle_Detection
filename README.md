#### CSS 487: Computer Vision Final Project

Taking steps toward autonomous vehicles. 

We developed a lane detection and vehicle detection program by utilizing various computer vision methods. As a summary, we utilized a Hough Transform for lane detection and a trained support vector machine on HOG image representations and sliding window in order to detect vehicles in a ROI (region of interest).

Our C++ solution requires C++17
